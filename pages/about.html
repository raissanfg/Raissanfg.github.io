        <p class="about-me">
            Welcome to my portfolio website, where you'll witness my dedication, drive, and unwavering passion for
            coding. Join me as I shape the future through innovative solutions and meaningful contributions in the world
            of technology<br>
            I'm Ra√≠ssa Gomes, an immigrant from Brazil, who has been proudly calling Chicago home for over a decade.
            <br>
            Throughout my journey, I've embraced diverse professional experiences, and now I'm ready to embark on an
            exciting tech venture. My passion lies in coding, and I'm determined to break into the tech industry.<br>
            As a Beginner Front End Developer, I've already made significant strides in my learning journey.<br>
            I've actively participated in two exceptional online bootcamp programs, supplemented by my relentless
            pursuit of self-study. This has provided me with a solid foundation in crucial programming languages such as
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moreover, I'm currently expanding my skill set by diving into the realm of
            React.<br>
            Driven by an insatiable thirst for growth, I'm actively seeking opportunities to refine my development
            skills and gain hands-on experience. Armed with my recent completion of a Front End Bootcamp, I possess the
            necessary expertise to create visually stunning and user-friendly websites and applications. I'm eager to
            contribute to collaborative work environments, where I can not only apply my existing skills but also
            continue my learning journey alongside like-minded professionals.<br>
            Approaching every challenge with an unwavering positive attitude, I'm ready to take on any task that comes
            my way. I thrive in an environment that fosters growth, as I believe it is the catalyst for achieving
            extraordinary results. With the next phase of my career on the horizon, I am wholeheartedly committed to
            making a significant impact in the tech industry.<br>
